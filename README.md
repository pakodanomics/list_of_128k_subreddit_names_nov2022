## WARNING: CONTAINS NSFW SUBREDDIT NAMES 
No segregation was made between subreddits that are NSFW and subreddits that are not NSFW. Use at your own peril. 

###### TERMS OF USE

The terms of use for this data are the same as the terms of use of the Pushshift API (they have no relation to me but since I 
have used their service, I think it's fair to respect their terms of use)
